A simple binary options trading bot that works on the olymp trade trading platform
There is no strategy behing how it works and therefore cannot be used for real trading.
It mimics a human. The program can check the account balance, set a stake, execute either an up trade or a down trade, check whether a trade was profitable or not, change stake, attemp to pick a price trend and stop trading when it reaches a stop loss or a take profit. All of this numbers(stake percentage, stop loss and take profit) are set from the source code directly. It was exiting building it :)
